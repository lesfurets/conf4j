Singleton-Conf  a devops configuration pattern.

Gilles Di Guglielmo et Dimitri Baeli from LesFurets.com devteam are suggesting to spend this session reviewing a simple pattern to avoid a dangerous situation even on small projects. 

Tired to see Dev and Ops playing a ping-pong communication with production configuration parameters, at LesFurets.com we decided to force a single point where to declare all production variables.
This has some huge benefits of allowing us to track the variable runtine setup, generate up to date documentation, dectect deprecated values, ... 

Those how never heard something like this from a Dev - Ops discussion during a critical deployment are not concerned by this presentation :-)
* Ops : Where and How do I set this new param-xxx for the server to start ?
* Dev : RTFM ! (Which in face means : RTFC - read the fucking code ... which eventually is not accessible by the Ops) !
* And the long discussion that follows, and ends with a change with a command line deep in the directory tree inside the application server installation (if not inside a curious .war file !)

The presentation is based on Java but focused on presenting patterns and usages which can be implemented in any 'cool' language.
